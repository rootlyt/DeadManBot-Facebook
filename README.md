# DeadManBot-Facebook

A bot to post your last will/word into your Facebook timeline

A Dead Man Switch *just google it if you really don't know what is this.
This bot is for you who live alone with no friends/ far from anyone and you want to send your last will/word/news if anything happens to you.
This bot will post your previously written txt files (lastword.txt) and post them to your Facebook timeline, using a countdown within a certain amount of time if you didn't exit / confirm you're still alive, it will post the "lastword" into your Facebook timeline.

#IF SOME OF YOU USING THIS FOR POSTING YOUR LAST WILL BEFORE/AFTER $UICIDE, PLEASE GO TALK TO SOMEONE, GET HELP, I DID NOT TELL YOU / RECOMMEND TO DO THAT. DO AT YOUR OWN RISK#

Requirement:

-Python 3.9
-Selenium
-Chromedriver

How to setup:

-fill the username/email on usr.txt.
-fill the password on pass.txt.
-fill the word or text you want to release if you didn't confirm you're alive (countdown can be edited on the deadmanbot.py).
-run the DeadManBot.py using a script or Windows Task Scheduler, run it every your computer startup, so you can confirm every 24H or edit it on the code as you need it.

I'm using both full desktop Facebook to login and mbasic to post because of the Facebook HTML class structure or some syit, 
I'm not an expert on this thing, even the python code may contain some broken logic :v (what do you expect)

If someday Szucc decided to change it's Facebook structure again, then you can change where the button textbox or anything, on the bot_ok.py.
if there is some missing citation in case I forgot to add it, feel free to contact me. I'll add it.
*This bot can or maybe fail, because I just do a small amount of testing, but it works well for me.. 
feel free to fork, edit or do anything with this. Just include me and the source.md citation. Thanks!
